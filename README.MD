# Getting Started with Goooo

This project is a custom Go web Framework using the MVC pattern. It's still far from perfection and will be updated and perfected along with time. The main purpose of this project is as an individual web framework template for my future project. However, anyone can use freely anything from this repository. Enjoy!
